                As a Director of Engineering, I bridge the gap between technical excellence and business outcomes. My journey spans over a decade of architecting distributed systems, leading engineering teams, and transforming how organizations approach software development.

            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Through <strong>CoderMana</strong>, I've partnered with industry leaders like Intel, Cisco, PayPal, and JP Morgan Chase to elevate their engineering practices. My training programs have impacted 3000+ engineers across 10+ industry domains, covering everything from Go and Rust to cloud-native architectures and distributed systems.

            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                I'm passionate about the craft of software engineering, sharing insights through conference talks (GopherCon Vietnam, GopherCon India), technical writing, and hands-on mentorship. Whether it's exploring Go's channel internals or debugging complex distributed systems, I believe in learning by doing and teaching by showing.
